- 👋 Hi, I’m @Garlic-rw
- 💙 I'm a sophomore undergrad student @UC Berkeley💙💛🐻(UC🥦). My major is bioengineering and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). I decide to double major beacuse I want to learn more in the interdisciplinary field between computer science and bioengineering. I'm currently interested in computational biology and especially its application in the clinical and medical field.
